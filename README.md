# Water-Quality-prediction
Water Quality analysis aims at predicting if water is potable i.e. safe for drinking
or not. Access to safe drinking water is an essential need of all human beings. The
quality of water depends on various factors that make it safe for drinking.

Project Description
The dataset that we will be using is the Water Potability dataset available online.
It contains 10 columns and 3276 data points.
The goal of the project is to predict if the water is safe to drink or not i.e. water is
potable or not based on various factors such as ph level, hardness, turbidity and
other elements present in it.
It is a classification type of problem.




1. pH value:

PH is an important parameter in evaluating the acid-base balance of water. It is also the indicator of acidic or alkaline condition of water status. WHO has recommended a maximum permissible limit of pH from 6.5 to 8.5. The current investigation ranges were 62-6.83 which is in the range of WHO standards.

2. Hardness:

Hardness is mainly caused by calcium and magnesium salts. These salts are dissolved from geologic deposits through which water travels. The length of time water is in contact with hardness-producing material helps determine how much hardness there is in raw water. Hardness was originally defined as the capacity of water to precipitate soap caused by Calcium and Magnesium.

3. Solids (Total dissolved solids - TDS):

Water has the ability to dissolve a wide range of Inorganic and organic minerals or salts such as potassium, calcium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, magnesium, sulfates, etc. These minerals produced an un-wanted taste and diluted color in the appearance of water. This is an important parameter for the use of water. The water with a high TDS value indicates that water is highly mineralized. The desirable limit for TDS is 500 mg/l and the maximum limit is 1000 mg/l which prescribed for drinking purpose

5. Sulfate:

Sulfates are naturally occurring substances that are found in minerals, soll, and rocks. They are present in ambient air, groundwater, plants, and food. The principal commercial use of sulfate is in the chemical Industry Sulfate concentration in seawater is about 2.700 milligrams per liter (mg/L). It ranges from 3 to 30 mg/L in most freshwater supplies, although much higher concentrations (1000 mg/L) are found in some geographic locations.

6. Conductivity:

Pure water is not a good conductor of electric current rather's a good insulator. An increase in ion concentration enhances the electrical conductivity of water. Generally, the amount of dissolved solids in water determines the electrical conductivity. Electrical conductivity (EC) actually measures the ionic process of a solution that enables it to transmit current. According to WHO standards, the EC value should not exceed 400 µS/cm

7. Organic carbon:

Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in source waters comes from decaying natural organic matter (NOM) as well as synthetic sources. TOC is a measure of the total amount of carbon in organic compounds in pure water. According to US EPA 2 mg/L is TOC in treated/drinking water, and <4 mg/Lit in source water is used for treatment.

8. Trihalomethanes:

THMs are chemicals that may be found in water treated with chlorine. The concentration of THMs in drinking water varies according to the level of organic material in the water, the amount of chlorine required to treat the water, and the temperature of the water that is being treated, THM levels up to 80 ppm Are considered safe in drinking water.

9. Turbidity:

The turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the suspended state. It is a measure of light emitting properties of water and the test is used to indicate the quality of waste discharge with respect to colloidal matter. The mean turbidity value obtained for Wondo Genet Campus (0.98 NTU) is lower than the WHO recommended value of 5.00 NTU.

10. Portability:

Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable. (0) Water is not safe to drink and (1) Water is safe to drink
